# Introduction to Powershell Basics, Unit Testing and TDD

[[_TOC_]]

## Introduction

This training is intended for people who have a beginner level in **any** of the following subjects:

1. Powershell
1. Automated Unit Testing
1. Git
1. Test-Driven Development
1. Ensemble programming (because it's fun!)

We will practice all of these topics by means of several 2-hour hands-on workshops in which we will work in an ensemble programming group to practice and learn the basics of the skills mentioned above.

The only requirement we have is that you have the ability to sign in to Rabobank Teams and that you bring your enthusiasm to share and learn!

Even if you have never written a line of code before, we can accommodate you in this workshop, so please do not let a lack of experience deter you!

> Please bear in mind, that due to the format of the workshop, we prefer people to have their cameras on. So please come prepared for that.
## Training Structure

The training is intended to stretch across 4 workshops 2 hours in length and will take the following approach:

1. **Session 1:** Introduction to ensemble programming (roles of navigator, driver, advisors). A brief introduction to Test-Driven Development followed by a hands-on code exercise.
2. **Session 2:** Continuing the hands-on exercise from _Session 1_ using all the skills we have already been practicing.
3. **Session 3:** Introduction to unit testing with 'legacy'code. We will take a hands-on ensemble approach to unit testing and refactoring existing code using test-driven development. The idea is to adapt a powershell script already written by the team or, if there are none, to tackle a concrete problem for which the team wants to write a powershell script (with tests).
4. **Session 4:** Continue the work from _Session 3_.

## Goals

The goals of the training is to provide you with the following knowledge:

1. An understanding of basic Powershell and how and where to write Powershell Scripts
1. How to use Visual Studio Code as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
1. The basics of working with git.
1. The basics of Test-Driven Development. Why it's useful and how to practice it.
1. The basics of unit testing.
1. Using PesterTest to write Powershell unit tests
1. Some basics of clean code and how/why to refactor
